Here are basics of markdown 

### Headers

 - Headers are denoted by # followed by spaces
 - The number of # deteremines the header level

>###### Best Practice
>
> - Always use space between # and first word
> - Put blank lines before and after the  # header line

Example:

         # Header Level 1
         ## Header Level 2 .. 
         ###### Header Level 6(last)

### Emphasis

- Bold double **
- Italics use single *

>###### Best Practice
>
>underscore can also be used instead of * but markup applciation can't work with using _ in middle of the word  

Example:

        **using bold**
        *italics*
        ***bold and italics***

### Blockquotes

- use > in front of paragraph 
- use  > even on blank lines between paragraph for multiparagraph blockquote
- Blockquote can be nested using >>

> ###### Best Practice
> 
> For compatibility and readability use blank lines before and after blockquotes

Example:

        >blockquotes title
        >
        >blockquoteheading

### Paragraph and Line Break

- use blank lines after a paragroph to start a new pragraph
- use two space to end the line and type return
- also use \ at end of the line ( not compatible with all applications)

> ######  Best Practice
> 
> - Dont use \ for line break
> - Unless Paragraph is in a list do not indent paragraph with space or tab

Example

        (this document is an example )

### List

- To create ordered list add numbers followed by period and space
- To create unordered list use - , * , or + followed by space
- Indent one or more item to create nested list 
- To add another element to the list use four space or a tab

>###### best practice
> - Use \ as escape if number followed by period is needed to be used
> - Use same delimiter in a list

Example

        1. open
        2. close

        - abc
        - def
            - ghi
            > blockquotes

### Code
    
- to denote a word as code enclose it in backtick (`)

Example:

        ``Use `code` in a line``

### Horizontal Rule

- use three or more ***, ___, or --- on a line by themselves
---

### Links
- to add links use square bracket followed by parenthesis 
- \[ url name ]( url link )
- \[ url name ]( url link "title" )
- to enclose link or email to link , enclose it in angle bracket
